# Xenium_run

This repository contains code for preprocessing **Xenium spatial transcriptomics data** generated by 10x Genomics. The preprocessing pipeline includes quality control, spatial metadata integration, expression matrix extraction, and downstream compatibility with common spatial analysis tools.

## 🧬 Project Description

This project was conducted as part of a short-term research internship in the **Zhang Yong Lab** at the **School of Life Sciences and Technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China**, from **August 21 to August 29, 2025**.

The objective of this project was to develop a pipeline for predicting cell cycle phases based on DAPI-stained nuclear images from Xenium spatial transcriptomics datasets by 10x Genomics. By integrating high-resolution morphology with cell-level metadata, this work aims to support spatially resolved functional analysis of proliferative states in complex tissues.

## 🧱 Main Features

-- Load and preprocess Xenium spatial output bundles  
-- Extract and align DAPI-stained nuclear images  
-- Perform image-based cell cycle phase prediction using morphological features  
-- Integrate predictions with transcriptomic and spatial metadata  
-- Enable downstream visualization and analysis of dividing vs non-dividing cells

## 📌 Notes

- The dataset used in this project is from a publicly available or test-run 10X Genomics Xenium output.
- This repo focuses on preprocessing; downstream spatial modeling is not included here.
